1. What do you mean by template engines in the Flask framework?  
A template is a file that contains two types of data, i.e., static and dynamic. Dynamic data in a template is populated  
during run time.  
  



  

1. How to serve static files in Flask?   
Dynamic web applications also need static files.Thatâ€™s usually where the CSS and JavaScript files are coming from.  
`url_for('static', filename='style.css')`  
The file has to be stored on the filesystem as static/style.css.   

1. What is Routing and how to use?  
Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.  
```   
from flask import Flask
# The decorator is telling our @app that whenever a user visits our app domain (myapp.com) at the given
# route(), execute the hello_world() function.
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'  
# Flask application is started by cal1ing run() function 
```

        return  redirect(url_for('user_name',name = user))

the response from the view function.

def user_name(user):
    return render_template('hello.html', name=user)
