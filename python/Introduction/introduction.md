python | java
|--- | ---|
| Python is an interpreted programming language|Java is a compiled programming language| 
| Python interpreters to execute the Python code directly|The Java code is initially compiled into bytecode that runs with Java Virtual Machine|
|Python code execution through several implementations such as Jython to compile the Python code into Java bytecode, and Cython to compile the Python code into C/C++ code| Java Virtual Machine (JVM) speeds up Java code execution through just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The JIT compiler compiles the bytecode to native machine code more quickly.  
| Python is used widely by scientific computing, big data, and artificial intelligence projects | Java work on projects related to network security, cyber attack prevention, and fraud detection.|
