* what is type.   
type() method returns class type of the argument(object) passed as parameter.    
Python have a built-in method called as type which generally come in handy while figuring out the type of      
variable used in the program in the runtime. If a single argument (object) is passed to type() built-in,      
it returns type of the given object.       
    
* complex number 
Complex numbers are numbers that consist of two parts â€” a real number and an imaginary number.   
It is expressed in the form a + bi.   
    
* list   
computer definition :     
    A list is an abstract data type that represents a countable number odordered values.   
    where the same value may occur more then once.           
python definition:    
    A list is an ordered set of values, where each value is identified by an index. The values that make up a list are   
    called its elements.[more](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch09.html) 
        
* tuple   
A tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable/not-change.Tuples are sequences, just like lists.  
The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use  
parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.   
   
* range 
Range in python is another in-built python datatype which is mainly used with loops in python.    
it is start from zero.    
    
* dict   
A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable. 
unordered mean dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position(index).
Keys cannot be changed. You will need to add a new key with the modified value then remove the old one.   
chnageable mean you can chnage the value of dictionary.      

* set  
Math definition. 
    A set is defined as an unordered collection of distinct elements of the same type.   
python definition:     
A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable/changed and has no duplicate elements.
