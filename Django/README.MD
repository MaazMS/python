#### Creating the Polls app   
* Django comes with a utility that automatically generates the basic directory structure of an app, so you can focus on  
 writing code rather than creating directories.  
* To create your app, make sure youâ€™re in the same directory as manage.py.  
* command for polls `python manage.py startapp polls`   
* directory polls, which is laid out like this:   
``` 
polls/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
```   
*  Projects vs. apps
