## Introduction   
OpenCV stands for Open Source Computer Vision . OpenCV  is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time 
computer vision.        
Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform    
and free for use under the open-source BSD license.       

OpenCv is used by image processing and understand the image which means the  what are the things in the image etc.   

Why do we need computer vision.?      
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.   
Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects        
and then react to what they “see.”       
   
   
## Requiremnet      
Firstly, you should have some basic programming knowledge in any language.    
Secondly, you should know what machine learning is and the basics of how it works, as we will be using some machine     
learning algorithms for image processing.   

## install Opencv in ubuntu 
 To  insatll opencv in ubuntu `pip install opencv-python` 
## How to openCV understand the image.   
1. Each image is represented by a set of pixels i.e. a matrix of pixel values.    
**Note** To know about the image pixel use **(PIL) python Image Library**  example [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/138260/9045475)      
2. For a grayscale image, the pixel values range from 0 to 255 and they represent the intensity of that pixel.   
`for example`    
if you have an image of 20 x 20 dimensions, it would be represented by a matrix of 20x20 (a total of 400-pixel values).     
``` 
greyscale : a range of grey shades from white to black .      

```     
  
3. If you are dealing with a colored image, you should know that it would have three channels - Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).   
The order of color is BGR is represent by row (height) , column (width), color (3).    
     
### why image range is 0 to 255


### about pixel 

1. what is pixel? 
It is the picture element. pixel is the small items in image.     

2.what are things carry in pixel? 
pixel contain the intensity information.    

3. how pixel is made?  
pixel is made by three colours **read,blue,green**(RBG)   

4. how many colour made by using RBG (read,blue,green)   
16777216. 1 core, 67  lakh, 77 thousand , 2 hundred, 16 ten.  
These colour is made by changing intensity of read,blue,green(RBG).   

### digital image basic 

For most images, pixel values are integers that range from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

The fundamental unit on a computer is a bit. A bit (binary unit) takes either the value 0 or 1. The byte is composed of   
8 bits. Since each bit takes on one of two values and 8 bits make a byte, we can use the multiplication principle to realize   
that there are `2 the power 8 ` = 256 possible bytes. We represent these bytes in base 2.
