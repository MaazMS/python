# variables are storing data/values.
# python has no command for declaring variable.
# A variables is created the moment yoy first assign the value.
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular data type
# data type of variable  can even change after they have been set.
# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
# A variable can have a short name and it's more descriptive name eg. age,name etc
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot start with a number if variable name is start number it give invalid syntax.

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
