## 1 . Whetting Your Appetite     

You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving    
around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games.    
Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large      
programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer.        



If youâ€™re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual    
write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of    
development time to get even a first-draft program.           
Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no           
compilation and linking is necessary.        


      
Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:  
* the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement.  
* statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets.
* no variable or argument declarations are necessary.         
               
               
      


   
Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types   
built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in   
a single statement      
       
     
         
Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs.Some of these modules   
provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.
